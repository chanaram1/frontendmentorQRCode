Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I have completed the Frontend Mentor - QR code component challenge to improve my coding skills and to continue to learn. The challenge of this project was to build a website that was as close to the desired image that was provided. This provided a real life expereience that could happen at the work place where the UI designer would give you something to see visually via Figma or Photoshop and you would have to build it out.
